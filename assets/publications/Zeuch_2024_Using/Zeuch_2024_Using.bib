abstract = {Soon, more data will be produced outside the cloud than inside. This constantly increasing amount of data requires new systems that can holistically optimize the processing for so-called sensor-fog-cloud environments. In this tutorial, we present NebulaStream, the first system designed specifically for this unified environment. We highlight research challenges inherent in managing data across a unified sensor-fog-cloud environment. After setting the scene, we dive into NebulaStream's architecture and system internals, which integrate cloud, fog, and sensor networks to meet these demands effectively. Finally, in a hands-on session, attendees can experience NebulaStream in action, learn how to configure and run IoT applications on the platform, and extend NebulaStream with custom functionalities. By the end of the tutorial, attendees will have a deeper understanding of NebulaStream and will be equipped with helpful guides to use it as a framework to try out their own ideas and benefit from its unique features.},
